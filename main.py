"""For this simulation, we will try to predict how much money we should budget for sales commissions for the next year.
Sales commissions can be a large selling expense and it is important to plan appropriately for this expense.
Therefore, build a Monte Carlo simulation using prior yearsâ€™ commissions payments to predict the range of potential
values for a sales compensation budget.

Number of sales agent = 500
Number of simulation = 1,000

Key Info: Sales Target, Actual Sales, Percent to Target, Commission Rate, Commission Amount
* Actual Sales = Sales Target * Percent to Target
* Commission Amount = Actual Sales * Commission Rate

* Percent to Target based on historical data:
Normally distributed with a mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0.1

* Sales Target based on historical data:
Sales Target  -  Probability
75,000        -  0.30
100,000       -  0.30
200,000       -  0.20
300,000       -  0.10
400,000       -  0.05
500,000       -  0.05

* Commission rate based on the table:
 0-90%  = 2%
 91-99% = 3%
 >=100% = 4%
